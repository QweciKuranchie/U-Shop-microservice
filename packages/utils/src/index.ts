// NOTE: `rateLimit` is intentionally NOT exported here. It depends on
// `next/server` and keeps module state, so it must only be imported by server
// code via "@repo/utils/rate-limit". Re-exporting it from this barrel pulled it
// (and, previously, a top-level setInterval) into 39 client components.
